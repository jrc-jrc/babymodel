data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_tni.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,As far as I can see uh this picture is actually showing two travelers who are actually going to the traveling to the same city and I can see that they are professionally dressed up that means they were actually going for some uh meeting and uh and in a hurry they uh while exiting from the airport they accidentally collided with each other and uh during the collision their bags got swagged and they mistakenly took uh each other's bag and went to their respective hotel and on reaching hotel they opened the luggage and they uh saw that uh they have mistakenly taken each other's uh luggage and they were actually uh kind of uh depressed because they had to actually go to the uh meeting immediately and now they were not having uh the uh cl uh the clothes which actually they decided to wear on the meeting day
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_tlv.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,So in a a big city there is a man and a woman who walking down the streets and they suddenly um hits each other at a corner of a building um and then they they continue walking with their suitcase um until they go until they arrive at home they feel now that or they just um mix up their suitcase they um like the man get the suitcase of the woman and the woman get the suitcase of the man uh the man figure out that there were dress dress in the suitcase uh the the woman ress in the suitcase and uh the the woman found the the yellow stripe cravat or ties of the man in in the suitcase
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_txhc.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Uh it's this story happened in a big city I think it's a rather tall building or an apartment building and there's a woman and a man each has a suitcase in their hands and uh when they turn the corner they uh run into each other and the suitcases were on the ground and so they when they rise again and they picked up the suitcase and went their sep separate ways but when they get to their I guess their apartments they found out that they took the wrong suitcase the man now had the woman's suitcase and he's smiling weirdly at those uh clothings and the woman was surprised to find that there was a tie in the suitcase and she must have realized that she took the wrong suitcase
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_njs.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Alright so one day in the morning there were two people traveling to their uh families and they bump into each other at the corner of the street when they bump into each other um they hea they hit their heads after they recover from the bump they said I'm sorry and they took their own suitcases and they parted their own ways when the man got to the hotel and opened his suitcase he realized that he had women's clothes when the woman opened her suitcase at her hotel she realized that she had men's clothes what had happened is that when these two people bumped into each other at the corner of the street they accidentally swapped their suitcases and therefore they got the wrong suitcase
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_zhaa.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,K well the first photo sho shows a uh high building it seems to be a modern busy city and then the second one shows a male and a female then the male is wearing um a suit and the female is wearing a skirt and she's also wearing a suit uh both holding uh suitcases uh they seems to be in a rush um they accidentally hit each other um uh then they seem to be switching their suitcases uh when the man opened the suitcase he found a woman dress uh and on the other hand when the women opened the suitcase she found it seems to be a yellow tie something like that
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_rrbi.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,So I see a busy New York City day on the Monday and uh two people after their big vacation coming back to the New York and walking in the parking uh lot they don't see each other near the pavement and they just collide after that they're trying to adjust their clothes and later after saying sorry to each other they take their bags and go away it seems both of their bags are of same color and same pattern so after going home they check the clothes inside the bag and it seems their bags are exchanged now so there was a miscommunication misunderstanding while ta uh picking up the bags
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_aba.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Yes um it seems that from the first pictures this is like a picture of um a downtown of a city with a big hotels and two two people one woman and one man went to this hotels and because there is no sign uh on the on the windows each one like crashed into each others and after that after crash uh they found that surprisingly they have the same color of the bag and I feel like it's similar bags actually and after crashing everyone took the each other's bag and after that when went back to the rooms they found that the man took the dress of the after his opening the the bag his bag he found that he took uh he found like a red dress of a woman and the woman found that uh a yellow tie of the man and I'm not sure what's what happened after that
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_ybaa.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,In a sunny nice day to a lady and a man living in a big city was preparing to go for a trip these two people do not know each other so they were walking on street and by coincidence they hit each other their bags fell down and so do them and uh after that by coincidence also they had the same type of bag so everyone took any bag from the ground and moved back to his home after that they when they reached home they discovered that they pick up picked up the wrong one the wrong wrong bag so I think they will I will thinking now of returning these bags
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_lxc.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,The uh in the city a woman and the man are hurrying to work with a big bag in their hands but uh at around the corner they crashed together and the the bags in their hands fall on the ground they all fall to the ground with with their hands with their heads shaking um and after that the the man wear his glasses and they apologize to each other for the crash uh uh but finally they smiled to each other and uh and get the get their bags and leave uh after they get home the man find there is woman the girl's dresses in the bag and uh he finally figured out that they had switched the bags uh and mistaken the woman's bags and uh also the woman found that there are men's clothes in the bag a long time
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_bwc.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Long long ago in a really big city and in a corner of the building a man and a woman just want to go to their destination and they both carry the same cases and but suddenly in a corner the man and the woman bumped into with each other and they just falled down and since their cases are the same they didn't pay attention to that so they just grabbed one and go to their go uh go to their destinations oh go to their home uh maybe their office but um when the man arrived his office he opened the case and found out that this case belongs to the woman and when the woman went back to his home she found to her home and she found out that the case belongs to the man so that's a mistake
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_hqtv.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,So this is a story about two persons one female one male who just uh walk on the street and they meet each other but accidentally they pick up the wrong briefcase and they recognize that they make it wrong when they get home and that's it sorry I not
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_ydck.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,"OK oh I can see sky skyscrapers tall buildings and i think it looks like a big city it is uh full of build big buildings and walls and cars And I guess the second thing shows the inside of the building and in that scene a woman and a man uh walking from th from different directions she's wearing um light green light green light green not a dress but form of suit and the man is wearing blue blue suit and they actually are carrying the exactly same looking suitcases or baggage and I think uh they're they are meeting at the corner and I think that they did not see each other but they were walking very fast so they um bumped into each other at the corner and they fell down uh and I think their suitcases are mixed here and she looks very not confused she feels dizzy because of the shock and he also looks very busy uh dizzy and his uh glasses is uh fallen on the floor but maybe after a few seconds uh a few minutes they uh they pull they are pulling themselves uh themselves together meaning the man is um wearing his glasses again And you know how to say this She's she's pulling herself and uh on the floor there are the the same suitcases they fell down the suitcases on the floor and after pulling themselves together they look they look happy they smile to each other and they they're taking the suitcase the suitcases and then they left And at home the man opened the suitcase, and found a slip woman's slip And I think that um because the suitcases look exactly the same they switched the suitcases That's why the man has the woman's suitcase and where suitcase where he found a woman's inner inner wear slip and he looks very embarrassed But kind of awkward smile on his face uh and then she uh when she arrived at home she also found out that that suitcase um was not hers because she found a necktie in the suitcase and unlike the man she looks very shocked instead of embarrassed uh when she uh found yellow striped neck uh necktie"
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_erms.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Okay it seems like um a regular day in the downtown of a big city so at one corner two persons just cross each other actually they crashed and curious thing was that each one of them was carrying exactly the same kind of bag a green one with golden filaments and so they crashed they got confused they take their bags and returned to whatever they were doing but when they arrive and to their places to work or home I don't know they opened the bag and they did realize that it wasn't uh their bags they just got the other person's bag so I was worried for her and it was kind of funny for him because of the thing they found in the bags
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_svbi.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,So there is some big city with big buildings and a man and a woman are walking past each other carrying identical luggage and they hit each other fall down fall next to each other and take their own respective luggages and start walking they reach home only to realize that they actually took the other person's luggage the man starts seeing the woman's clothes in the suitcase and the woman starts seeing the man's clothes

data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_hkk.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Um okay in the city I think um there are many skyscrapers and um the many cars uh not so many cars on the road and in the corner of the building the two people are walking into the same directions and they're carrying the same carrier I think I mean the suitcase I think um because they did not see each other they just bumped into each other and um and especially for the man he dropped his glasses um after bumping into each other um they seem to have a headache because there is the uh stars going around their over their heads and after that they said to just the I'm sorry to each other and um pick up their own suitcases but and they just did uh went to their own direction I mean their destinations but after that when just they opened their um suitcases they found out it it's just they pick up their wrong suitcase because for the man in his suitcase they I mean he just he found out that uh the red underwear was in the suitcase whereas the the woman found out that in her suitcase there was the um the yellow striped uh necktie in the suitcase so
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_ebvs.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,This is a history like it happened in a big city is probably New York or something like that there are two kinds of of house one a big apartments or buildings for business um a small house there there's a history from one man and one women like they across each other in a way in the corner and they confuse their suitcase each other's like instead they crash each other and after that when they get home they figure out like their suitcase like get everyone it not the the real their real suitcase and want and the man look at one red dress and the woman uh yellow tie and it happening when they when the really really go go from s from somewhere and they really it doesn't matter because they don't want that they want it
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_pnv.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,So um in a very big city um two people um a man and a woman were carrying um their suitcases which are both green and um which looks very similar um however as they were crossing um it was cornering um they bumped into each other um and then they um picked up their own suitcase and went separate ways after that after the man uh came back to his hotel he found out that his suitcase contained um women um clothes actually a red dress obviously um that suitcase was not his and similarly the woman found out that uh she had a tie in her suitcase so um so they picked up the wrong suitcase
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_hjk.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Okay um Tom had a business trip to New York this Sunday so he went to uh this nice hotel in Wall Street and he was late after he finished his uh business he was supposed to go to the airport early in the morning but he was late for the flight so while rushing to the airport he uh ran into a woman and they got just crashed each other and then since he was in a rush he just picked up one s big suitcase that he thought as his his own sc suitcase he just rushed to the airport and then after he got to got back to his home he realized that he did um he took the wrong one the wrong suitcase because there was a woman's inner wear in the suitcase and then that's the same woman after got she got back to the hotel she realized that she also got the wrong suitcase
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_ykwk.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,Uh in a large city building uh there was two people who were carrying similar suitcases uh a lady uh a lady who was carrying a similar suitcase with a guy who was who is wearing uh uh wearing suit and then they bumped into each other at the corner of the the hallway and then they were knocked down on the ground on the hallway so they probably exchanged their uh excuses to each other and then they uh they pick up their stuffs and then took one of the briefcase uh suitcases for suitcases and then they probably thought that those are their suitcases and their went they went on their own way and then they arrived in their hotel room and the guy found a s uh s woman's s uh swimming suit in the brief in the suitcase that he carried and then the woman found an a necktie of a guy in her suitcase so we can assume that probably they have their uh have a wrong suitcases and then that's it
data/audio/processed/l2arctic/suitcase_corpus_mbmps.wav,suitcase_corpus,Unknown,Unknown,In a very big city two people a woman and a man were walking on the street suddenly they both reach a corner they hit each other in the head they are a little bit hurt and confused curiously both have uh green suitcase both look very similar in the middle of the distraction they just get together and put together and then each one of them take one of the suitcases and apologizing for the confusion they just said bye each one of them take their own path suddenly when they open the suitcase they realize that they switched the suitcases cases so he ended with a very woman feminine red blouse while she ended with a yellow tie
